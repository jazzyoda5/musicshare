HANG

The world is locked down. This means so many musician cats can't go out, get together and do the hang. There is no way to share hip music and make the noises like "That is so killing, man!" or "Bro, did you check out the new Jacob Collier s***, man?!", or if they are into classical "What a fine touch this chap has on his stradivarious.".
This is where HANG comes in. It provides everything a proper music hang needs, without needing to leave your house! Find your friends and hang just like your are at a session in Small's, but without leaving the house.
